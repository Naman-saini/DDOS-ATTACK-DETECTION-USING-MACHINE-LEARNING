## Project Description
With the increase in technological advancement, especially the internet, there come various kinds of network attacks. DOS attacks pose one of the most challenging security threats in today’s generation of internet. In addition, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are of a particular concern whose impact can be proportionally severe. The challenging part of this attack is that it comes with little or no advance warning and could easily exhaust away the communication or computation resources of the victim in a short span of time. These attacks are becoming advanced day-by-day and are increasing in number thus making it difficult to detect and counter such attacks. In addition to detecting the upsurge of packets during DDoS attack using Wireshark, we have used numerous Machine Learning techniques for effective detection of DDoS flooding attack such as K-Nearest Neighbors, SGD, Multi-layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Quadratic discriminant and deep learning techniques such as DNN etc. A detailed comparative analysis of the aforementioned algorithms is performed and is evaluated based on the accuracy metrics.

## Details of algorithms used


#### Decision Tree
Decision Tree belong to the class of non-parametric supervised learning method. It is mainly used for the purpose of solving the regression and the classification problems. The major aim is to build a model which predicts the value of a target variable which is done by learning the simple decision tree rules that are inferred from the features of the data. The tree is seen as a piecewise constant approximation. For solving the classification problem, the class DecisionTreeClassifier is used. The class is well equipped to perform a multi-class classification on the dataset. The classifier takes two arrays as input: an array X or dense, having shape (n_samples, n_features) which hold the training samples of the dataset, and an array Y which have integer values having shape (n_samples) which hold the class labels of the corresponding training samples. After model 
fitting, the model is used for making predictions of class of the samples. In the case of multiple classes with the exact same and highest probability, the classifier 
tends to predict the class which has the lowest index among the classes. Besides outputting to a specific class, the probability of each class could be predicted 
which constitutes the fraction of the training sample of the class in a leaf. The classifier is capable for classifying both multi-class classification and binary lassification.


#### Random Forest
The Random Forest classifier makes use of ensemble learning technique as it constitutes of many decision trees. All the individual trees present as a part of random forest provide a class prediction. Subsequently, the class with the highest number of votes becomes the prediction of the entire model. The core idea of the classifier is to have a significant number of trees which operate together as a whole to outperform any of the individual constituent models. The key is low correlation between the models. Uncorrelated models have the capability to produce more accurate models than any of the individual predictions. The main reason is that the trees protect one another from individual errors. While some trees might be wrong, if many other trees are right, then, the group of trees would be able to move towards the right direction. The classifier makes use of feature randomness and bagging to build each individual tree to create an uncorrelated forest of trees.


## Dataset Description
The DDoS attack dataset is a SDN specific dataset that is generated by making use of the mininet emulator and is mainly used for the classification of traffic by numerous deep learning and machine learning algorithms. The process involved for the creation of the dataset includes the creation of ten topologies in mininet where the switches were connected to a single Ryu controller. The network simulation runs for the both the benign UDP, ICMP and TCP traffic as well as the collection of malicious traffic for TCP Syn attack, ICMP attack and UDP flood attack. The dataset includes 23 features in total where some of the data is extracted from the switches and others were calculated. Extracted features which are present in the dataset include: -

Packet_count – refers to the count of packets <br/>
byte_count – refers to the count of bytes in the packet <br />
Switch-id – ID of the switch <br />
duration_sec – packet transmission (in seconds) <br />
duration_nsec – packet transmission (in nanoseconds) <br />
Source IP – IP address of the source machine <br />
Destination IP – IP address of the destination machine <br />
Port Number – Port number of the application <br />
tx_bytes – number of bytes transferred from the switch port <br />
rx_bytes – number of bytes received on the switch port <br />
dt field – shows the date and time which has been converted into a number and the flow is monitored at a monitoring interval of 30 seconds<br />
<br />
The calculated features present in the dataset include: <br />
Byte Per Flow – byte count during a single flow<br />
Packet Per Flow – packet count during a single flow<br />
Packet Rate – number of packets transmitted per second and calculated by dividing the packet per flow by monitoring interval<br />
number of Packet_ins messages – messages that are generated by the switch and is sent to the controller <br />
Flow entries of switch – entries in the flow table of a switch which is used to match and process packets<br />
tx_kbps – Speed of packet transmission (in kbps)<br />
rx_kbps - Speed of packet reception (in kbps)<br />
Port Bandwidth – Sum of tx_kbps and rx_kbps<br />

The output feature is the last column of the dataset i.e. class label which classifies the traffic type to be benign or malicious. The malicious traffic is labelled as 1 and the benign traffic is labelled as 0. The simulation of the network was run for approximately 250 minutes and 1,04,345 instances of data were collected and recorded. Further, the simulation was run for a given interval to collect more instances of data.

## Results
DDoS attacks analysis and detection were performed using machine learning method. In this work, a SDN specific dataset is used. The dataset originally includes 23 features. The output feature is the last column of the dataset i.e. class label which classifies the traffic type to be benign or malicious. The malicious traffic is labelled as 1 and the benign traffic is labelled as 0. It has 104345 instances. The null values were observed in the rx_kbps and tot_kbps and were hence dropped for model development. The data processing steps were completed, including data preparation/cleaning, One Hot encoding, and normalization. After one hot encoding the dataframe had 103839 instances with 57 features and was fed into the model.A Deep Neural Network was used as the proposed model. The efficacy of our proposed model was observed to be higher than that of the baseline classifiers used. The accuracy of our proposed model was observed to be 87% which is approximately 1.21% higher than the next best model XGBoost whose accuracy stands at 98.17%
